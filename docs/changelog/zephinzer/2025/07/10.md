# Updates made on 10th July 2025

- [x] Add storage of ApprovalRequest sent via Slack in Redis
  - This was already done since the saving of the ApprovalRequest is being done in the HTTP handler
- [x] Add a Link to the `ApprovalRequest` specification
  - *added as `Url`*
- [x] Remove useless `ChatMap` property in the Telegram notifier
- [x] Add a `Webhook` property to the `ApprovalRequest` specification so that the approver service can ping a consumer when a request is approved or rejected
  - added as `WebhookUrl`
- [x] Add helper service to log any requests sent to it and respond with ok
- [x] Add `slack_templates.go` so that message formatting is accurate in Slack

## Learnings
