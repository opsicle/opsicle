# Updates made on 9th July 2025

- [x] Add `mfaSeed` as a field for the approval request specification so that a consumer can enable MFA for approvals
  - Added to the requester specification so that each requester can be evaluated independently of others
- [x] Refactored the `getDefaultHandler` for Telegram so that it's split up into logical parts and can be read more easily
- [x] In the `TelegramRequestSpec` processing, de-dupe the chat IDs so that each chat only receives the message once in the case of a single chat containing multiple authorised approvers
- [x] Implemented barebones structure for Slack as a `Notifier` in the `internal/approver` package
- [x] Slack approval flow can be achieved using an example ApprovalRequest manifest
