## Learnings

## Next time

- [ ] Create test case using example YAML for demonstrating running at `Automation` with approval requests in place
- [ ] Implement some kind of secret retrieval mechanism to retrieve username/passwords/bearer tokens/header tokens from (for webhook callbacks)
- [ ] Refactor Telegram approval/rejection so that they can share the same function similar to how the Slack implementation does it (in a "handle response" manner instead of an explicit approve/reject function with duplicate code)
- [ ] Implement effects for the `Title` field in the `RequestSpec` class
- [ ] Implement handling for the `TtlSeconds` field in the `RequestSpec` class
- [ ] Implement display of the `Url` field in the `RequestSpec` class
- [ ] Update `opsicle run automationtemplate` to use the filesystem queue instead of including inline logic
- [ ] Create the controller server
  - [ ] Controller server listens on a port
  - [ ] Add CLI flag `--local` mode to indicate to the CLI that it's working locally, otherwise, communicate with the controller server via `--controller-url`
  - [ ] Controller server handles endpoint `Get /automation-template` to retrieve available automation templates
  - [ ] Create CLI `opsicle get automationtemplates` that retrieves available automation templates
  - [ ] Controller server handles endpoint `POST /automation-template` to save an automation template
  - [ ] Create CLI `opsicle submit automationtemplate` that saves an automation template
  - [ ] Controller server handles endpoint `POST /automation` to run an automation template
  - [ ] Create CLI `opsicle trigger automationtemplate` that runs an automation template
  - [ ] Controller server handles endpoint `POST /approval-policy` to create an approval policy
