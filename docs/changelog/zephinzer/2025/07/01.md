# Updates made on 1st July 2025

- Started on the Approver service
- Currently integrating the code 
- Turns out it takes longer than 1 hour (my timebox) to do this
- Redis is startable via Docker Compose
- Redis test connections are succeeding on start of the Approver service
- Telegram bot is startable
- Telegram bot can receive updates

## Next time:

- Formalise the HTTP server
  - It needs to be able to gracefully shutdown on SIGKILL
  - This `^` means that it needs to be an object instead of using the default `http` listener
- Try out the end to end flow of sending an approval message via the server endpoint, receiving an approval message on Telegram, approving, and receiving the approval back on the approval service
