# Updates made on 23rd July 2025

- [x] Refactor the `approver` service's HTTP server so that `approver` only adds the router to the server, the server initialisation code should be in the `internal/common` package so that it can also be used by the `controller`
- [x] Update the `swaggo` documentation generation recipe to place documentation for the `approver` service inside the `approver` directory and scope it only to the `approver` service

## Learnings

## Next time

- [ ] Create the controller server
  - [ ] Controller server listens on a port

  - [ ] Controller server handles endpoint `GET /automation-template` to retrieve available automation templates
  - [ ] Create CLI `opsicle get automationtemplates` that retrieves available automation templates

  - [ ] Create CLI `opsicle submit automationtemplate` that saves an automation template
  - [ ] Controller server handles endpoint `POST /automation` to run an automation template
  - [ ] Create CLI `opsicle trigger automationtemplate` that runs an automation template
  - [ ] Controller server handles endpoint `POST /approval-policy` to create an approval policy
- [ ] Implement some kind of secret retrieval mechanism to retrieve username/passwords/bearer tokens/header tokens from (for webhook callbacks)
- [ ] Refactor Telegram approval/rejection so that they can share the same function similar to how the Slack implementation does it (in a "handle response" manner instead of an explicit approve/reject function with duplicate code)
- [ ] Implement effects for the `Title` field in the `RequestSpec` class
- [ ] Implement handling for the `TtlSeconds` field in the `RequestSpec` class
  - [ ] Update approver service to check for `ttl` on any interaction and failing it
