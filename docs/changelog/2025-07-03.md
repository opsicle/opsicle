# Updates made on 3rd July 2025

- Finished the HTTP service
- Finished the Telegram Bot service
- Added `opsicle start helper telegrambot` to allow discovery of chat ID
- Approver service can now start and an approval text can be sent to Telegram (YAY!)

## Next time:

- Move `config.LogLevel*` into `common.LogLevel*` as a sanity refactor
- Find out how to get the chat ID of a callback query
- Parse the callback query into the action and related request ID
- Check if the endpoint actually sends data to redis
