# Changelog

This changelog is optional to add to but I find it gives a nice sense of progress/what to do next. To add to the changelog:

1. Create a directory in this directory with your github username
2. In your user directory, structure the files like `${YEAR}/${MONTH}/${DATE}.yaml`, this prevents a single directory from being overloaded
