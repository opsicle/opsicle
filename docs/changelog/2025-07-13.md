# Updates made on 13th July 2025

- [x] Implement use of webhook if the field is non-nil after an approval request is approved/rejected

## Learnings


## Next time

- [ ] Implement some kind of secret retrieval mechanism to retrieve username/passwords/bearer tokens/header tokens from (for webhook callbacks)
- [ ] Refactor Telegram approval/rejection so that they can share the same function similar to how the Slack implementation does it (in a "handle response" manner instead of an explicit approve/reject function with duplicate code)
- [ ] Implement a way to specify the approval mechanism in the `AutomationTemplate` resource
- [ ] Create test case using example YAML for demonstrating running at `Automation` with approval requests in place
- [ ] Fix bug where ID seemingly cannot be longer than a certain length (this is in Telegram only - button data has a maximum size of 64 characters - might need to change caching set/get mechanism to use only the request uuid or else do some fixed character hash of the request id)
