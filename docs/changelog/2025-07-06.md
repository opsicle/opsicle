# Updates made on 6th July 2025

- [x] Refactor the HTTP section of the `internal/approver` package so that it's cleaner to read
- [x] Update the Telegram section of the `internal/approver` package so that it follows the current logic
- [x] Implement endpoint for retrieving an approval by it's ID which should return it's status including approval status
  - This is so that the consumer can do up a polling mechanism that queries this endpoint to retrieve the status instead of waiting on the transaction which can fail for networking reasons
- [x] Update the `.Approval` property to include the approver and details about the approval/rejection action
- [x] Update current HTTP endpoint to `/approval-request/{requestId}/{requestUuid}` for retrieving Approval Request resources
- [x] Add an endpoint `/approval/{approvalId}` for retrieving Approval resources

## Next time:

- [ ] Implement a timeout/TTL feature in the approval request creation, once timeout is reached, the approval request becomes invalid and any approval/rejection action on it will change the message to indicate that it's no longer valid
  - Perhaps implement a job that routinely updates the messages of invalid jobs
  - The expiry set on the cache should be AFTER the message's programmatically set TTL
- [ ] Implement notification of the end-user when a system error happens during approval/rejection
